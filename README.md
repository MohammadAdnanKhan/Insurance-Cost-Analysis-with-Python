# Python-Project-for-DA
Data Analyst Project at a Real Estate Investment Trust

The project focuses on conducting data analytics on an insurance cost dataset to unveil insights into the factors influencing insurance charges. By analyzing parameters such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, region, and insurance charges, I aimed to uncover trends, correlations, and predictive patterns within the data. Leveraging techniques from data science and machine learning, I explore how these variables interact and impact insurance costs, providing valuable insights for insurance companies to better understand their clientele and optimize pricing strategies. Through visualization of the data and potentially building predictive models, the project seeks to empower stakeholders with actionable insights to make informed decisions in the dynamic insurance landscape
